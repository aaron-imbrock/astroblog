Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

```python
def cthulhu_room():
    print("""
    Here you see the great evil Cthulhu.
    He, it, whatever stares at you and you go insane.
    Do you flee for your life or eat your head?
    """)

    choice = input("> ")

    if "flee" in choice:
        start()
    elif "head" in choice:
        dead("Well that was tasty!")
    else:
        cthulhu_room()

def dead(why):
    print(why, "Good job!")
    exit(0) 
```

## YAML Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
     app: myapp
     type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx
```

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
